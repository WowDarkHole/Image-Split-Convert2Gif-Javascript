# Image-Split-Convert2Gif-Javascript
Split Image to pieces and make an gif from that

Make an Input Folder and an Output Folder for Images.
-Input (images/png/jpg/jpeg/gif)
-Output (gif)

This project used gif-encoder-2 for generating gif from split canvas items.

The image will split from top to end and piece size is 250px. (you can modify this number in the code easily).

I made this for generating nft gif arts.

Thank you for your kind read. #Polly#
